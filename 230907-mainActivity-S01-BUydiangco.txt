Hi, My name is Benedict Eric Uydiangco.


I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at DLSUD. I have recently completed my required internship at Hacktive Collab, Inc., and it was a great experience. During my internship, I had the opportunity to work with Microsoft Power Platform, which offers a range of useful applications, including automation, database management, model-driven apps, and more.
