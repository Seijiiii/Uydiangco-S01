Hi, My name is Benedict Eric Uydiangco.


I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at DLSUD. I have recently completed my required internship at Hacktive Collab, Inc., and it was a great experience. 
During my internship, I had the opportunity to work with Microsoft Power Platform, which offers a range of useful applications, including automation, database management, model-driven apps, and more.

I studied SHS in LPU-Cavite with TVL-ICT. It was a valuable experience considering many events happened during our school year, and i had the opportunity to make many friends during that time. 

Top 5 hobbies/things i like ???
1. I like playing video games ( Valorant, DOTA2, CSGO, Warframe, Soul-games, etc??)  
2. I like watching cats minding their own business and its cute (i love cats)
3. I like cold brew coffee (1-3 espresso shots and no sweetener)
4. I like watching movies & K-Drama (action, comedy, horror, sci-fi, any with good cinematography shots)
5. I like photography
